# Robotics PCB Designs

This repository contains a compilation of custom-designed printed circuit boards (PCBs) created by Meet Jain. These boards support **end-to-end robotics system development**, with modules ranging from motor drivers and power distribution systems to microcontroller control boards.

> All designs are consolidated in [PCB_WORK_MEET.pdf](./PCB_WORK_MEET.pdf)
